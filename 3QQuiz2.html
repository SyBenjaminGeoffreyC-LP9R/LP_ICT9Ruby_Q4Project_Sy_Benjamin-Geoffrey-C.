			<i>"Great sequel. I am a die hard Percy Jackson fan and I will hinestly never stop. This novel in particular is such a well done book I cannot shut up about it. There are so many Percabeth moments it isn't even funny. Tyson was a great addition to this universe. I also loved and hated the fact that Percy kind of started to disown Tyson because how everyone was bullying Percy for having Tyson as a character. It made us remember that like everyone Percy is not Perfect. There was also a fair amount of world development. Now I gotta eat a monster donut. Byeee."</i></div>

			<i>"I skimmed through this series when I was eight, and I still haven't fully recovered. This, out of all the books, was perhaps my favorite. I mostly favored the characters (Zoe, Bianca, Artemis, Apollo, Nico, etc.) because they were so well written and had gave me thrills whenever they spoke or acted. The winter scenery-unlike the other summer novels-made the novel so much better. I enjoyed how Percy sneaked out to help on the quest to save Annabeth while it's really a mission so he can find out his true feelings for her. I could go on and on about how amazing this book is, but there are no words to describe it."</i></div>

			<i>"This book was amazing, there were so many times when you think something would happen and you would be completely wrong. Rick Riordan does a great job adding a good plot and adding new characters along the way. My favorite part is when Percy Jackson is cornered in a room and he summons a tidal wave to escape death. There are also many parts like when Quentin gives Percy a whistle and you just have to think, when and where will he end up using it. If you are looking for a book with magic, mystery, and suspense this is the book for you. 10/10 this book was great I can't wait to read the next book."</i></div>

			<i>"This book is the absolute perfect ending to an amazing series. Everything is rounded up so well. I love how Rick Riordan manages to get so many funny moments into the book, even when everything seems so dark. Everything fits together so well, and everything is explainded in such great ways. If you love books, but haven't read Percy Jackson you're really missing out. And even if you dont like reading then Percy Jackson is a great book to get you started! Amazingly written book!!"</i></div>

			<i>"Back in the day when I thought I'd absolutely love this series, I invested not only in the illustrated edition of volume 1, but also in 3 companion books. This is one of them.

This book tells of the Greek heroes and the monsters they slew or tasks they had to accomplish (which often also included solving riddles). As with the other companion book, this mostly focuses on the heroes we know from the Percy Jackson series. [...] We get some of the most well-known stories from Greek mythology, such as the defeat of the kraken as well as the minotaur, the accomplishments of the Amazons, Morpheus' attempt at getting his true love back, Hercules' labours and more."</i></div>
